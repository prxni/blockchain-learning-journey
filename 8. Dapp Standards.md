## **Importance of Standards in Technology**

- Rapid technological growth requires standards for order and regulation.
    
- Historical examples:
    
    - **POSIX**: Ensured interoperability among different operating systems.
        
    - **IETF & RFCs**: Defined Internet standards.
        
    - **ISO Aviation Standards**: Enabled flights to land in compliant airports worldwide.
        
- Standards ensure safety, order, regulation, and clarity in evolving technologies.
    
- **Blockchain** is a high-interest technology needing standardization.
    

## **Ethereum Standards & EIPs**

- **EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal)**: Governs Ethereum protocol updates and improvements.
    
- EIP categories:
    
    1. **Core**: Ethereum protocol improvements.
        
    2. **Network**: Network-level enhancements.
        
    3. **Interface**: Covers ABI, RPC, etc.
        
    4. **ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments)**: Application-level standards for DApps.
        
- ERC proposals undergo community discussion on GitHub and other platforms.
    
- Accepted ERCs become finalized and are allocated an EIP number for implementation.
    

### **ERC Token Standards**

- ERC standards define token behavior within the Ethereum network.
    
- Tokens can represent assets, investments, or utilities.
    
- Key questions:
    
    - What does a token represent?
        
    - Is it fungible or non-fungible?
        
    - Can it be exchanged for another token or fiat currency?
        
- ERC standards address these concerns.
    

### **ERC20: The Fungible Token Standard**

- ERC20 defines a smart contract interface for fungible tokens.
    
- Characteristics:
    
    - **Fungibility**: One token is interchangeable with another of the same type.
        
    - Used for cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and governance tokens.
        
    - Examples: **Augur (REP), DAI, USDT**.
        
- ERC20 tokens enable seamless interaction between DApps on Ethereum.
    

### **ERC721: The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Standard**

- **Non-fungible**: Each token is unique and cannot be exchanged one-to-one.
    
- Example Comparisons:
    
    - One **US dollar** = another US dollar (fungible).
        
    - **Puppy A Token ≠ Puppy B Token** (non-fungible).
        
    - **Collectible penny ≠ Ordinary penny**.
        
    - **Pokemon cards, baseball cards, real estate** – each has different values.
        
- **CryptoKitties**:
    
    - Popularized NFTs by conforming to ERC721.
        
    - Once contributed to 30% of Ethereum’s traffic.
        
- **Applications beyond collectibles**:
    
    - Identity, governance, security.
        
    - Represents a major shift in the DApp ecosystem.
        

### **Future of Ethereum Token Standards**

- ERC721 is just the beginning of more advanced token standards.
    
- Ethereum is evolving into a mainstream application framework.
    
- Decentralization is becoming a norm with standardized tokens and EIPs.
