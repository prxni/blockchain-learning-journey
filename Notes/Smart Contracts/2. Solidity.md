# Solidity and Smart Contracts

## **Introduction to Solidity**

- **Purpose:** Solidity is a high-level programming language designed to implement smart contracts targeting the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- **Features:** Combines elements of JavaScript, Java, and C++.
- **Development Environment:**
    - **Remix Web IDE:** Preferred for its ease of use, built-in compiler, runtime for testing, and no installation requirements.
    - **Supported Test Environments in Remix:**
        - JavaScript VM (used in this module).
        - Injected Web3 (e.g., MetaMask).
        - Web3 Provider (e.g., a local Ethereum node).

---

## **Structure of a Smart Contract**

1. **Data/State Variables:**
    
    - Hold the state of the contract.
2. **Functions:** Various types include:
    
    - **Constructor:**
        - Default or user-specified.
        - Only one allowed per contract (no overloading).
    - **Fallback Function:**
        - Anonymous, powerful feature (to be discussed in later courses).
    - **View Functions:**
        - No state changes.
        - Computes and returns values (e.g., mathematical functions).
    - **Pure Functions:**
        - Do not modify or read state variables.
    - **Public Functions:**
        - Accessible from outside the contract.
        - Changes in state are recorded on the blockchain.
    - **Private Functions:**
        - Accessible only within the contract.
    - **Internal Functions:**
        - Accessible within the contract and inherited contracts.
    - **External Functions:**
        - Accessible only from outside the smart contract.
3. **User-Defined Types:**
    
    - **Structs:** Define custom types.
    - **Enums:** Represent a set of predefined constants.
4. **Modifiers:**
    
    - Modify the behavior of a function.
5. **Events:**
    
    - Allow logging and communication between the contract and external systems.

---

### **Inheritance**

- A smart contract can inherit properties and functionalities from another contract.
- Example:
    - `StandardPolicies` defines base policies applicable to all states.
    - `NYPolicies` inherits from `StandardPolicies` and adds additional policies.

---

### **Functions in Solidity**

- **Definition:** Similar to functions in other high-level languages, with a header and a body enclosed in curly braces.
- **Function Header Components:**
    - **Keyword:** All functions begin with the `function` keyword.
    - **Parameters:** Type and identifier pairs (e.g., `uint count`).
    - **Return Parameters:**
        - Defined as a type (optional identifier).
        - If only the type is defined, an explicit `return` statement is required.
        - If type and identifier are defined, the identifier is automatically returned if modified.
        - Supports multiple return values (e.g., age and gender from `getAgeGender` function).

# Basic Data Types and Statements in Solidity


## **Basic Data Types in Solidity**

Solidity supports standard data types similar to high-level programming languages. These include:

1. **Integer (`int`, `uint`)**
    
    - Used for signed (`int`) or unsigned (`uint`) integers.
    - Examples:
        - `int256`: Signed 256-bit integer.
        - `uint128`: Unsigned 128-bit integer.
    - Default: `uint` (alias for `uint256`).
2. **Boolean (`bool`)**
    
    - Represents `true` or `false`.
    - Example:
        - `bool isEligible = true;`
3. **String (`string`)**
    
    - Stores text data.
    - Example:
        - `string public name = "Alice";`
4. **Address (`address`)**
    
    - Stores Ethereum addresses.
    - Example:
        - `address public owner;`
5. **Bytes (`bytes`)**
    
    - Fixed-size or dynamically-sized arrays of bytes.
    - Examples:
        - `bytes32`: Fixed-size array of 32 bytes.
        - `bytes`: Dynamically-sized byte array.

---

### **Visibility Modifiers**

- **Default Modifier:**
    - Private by default unless specified otherwise.
- **Public Modifier:**
    - Explicitly allows external access to variables and functions.
    - Public variables automatically generate **getter functions**.

**Example:**

```solidity
uint public bidAmount = 20000; // Accessible externally
string private secretMessage = "Hidden"; // Not accessible externally
```

---

### **Common Statements in Solidity**

Solidity supports common programming constructs with minor variations:

1. **Assignment**
    
    - Assign values to variables.
    - Example:
        
        ```solidity
        uint amount = 1000;
        ```
        
2. **Conditional Statements (`if-else`)**
    
    - Execute logic based on conditions.
    - Example:
        
        ```solidity
        if (bidAmount > 1000) {
            isEligible = true;
        } else {
            isEligible = false;
        }
        ```
        
3. **Loops (`for`, `while`)**
    
    - Iterate over a block of code.
    - Example:
        
        ```solidity
        for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            total += i;
        }
        ```
        
4. **Modifiers (`require`, `assert`, `revert`)**
    
    - Control logic execution and validate conditions.
    - Example:
        
        ```solidity
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
        ```
        

---

### **Example: Bidder Contract - Data Types in Action**

Below is a simple illustration of state variables and their initialization:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Bidder {
    string public name;         // Bidder's name
    uint public bidAmount = 20000;  // Initial bid amount
    bool public isEligible;     // Eligibility status

    // Function to determine eligibility based on bid amount
    function determineEligibility() public {
        if (bidAmount > 1000) {
            isEligible = true;
        } else {
            isEligible = false;
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **Key Takeaways**

1. Solidity's data types are straightforward but should be used efficiently to minimize gas costs.
2. Visibility modifiers like `public` and `private` help control external access.
3. Familiar control statements (`if`, `for`, etc.) operate similarly to other high-level languages.
4. Solidity encourages explicit design—plan data and logic structure before coding.

# SpecificData Types 

## **Key Data Types in Solidity**

1. **Address**
    - A special Solidity-defined composite data type.
    - **Characteristics:**
        - Holds a 20-byte Ethereum address.
        - References accounts or smart contracts.
        - Can access the balance of the account in Wei.
        - Includes methods like `transfer` to send Ether to specific addresses.
    - **Example:**
        
        ```solidity
        address public owner;
        owner = msg.sender; // Sets the owner as the contract creator.
        owner.transfer(1 ether); // Transfers 1 Ether to the owner address.
        ```
        

---

2. **Mapping**
    - A key-value store similar to a hash table.
    - **Key:** Typically a secure hash of simple Solidity data types like `address`.
    - **Value:** Can be any arbitrary type.
    - **Use Cases:**
        - Mapping phone numbers to names.
        - Mapping Ethereum addresses to structured customer data.
    - **Syntax Example:**
        
        ```solidity
        mapping(address => uint) public balances;
        
        // Add balance
        function addBalance(address user, uint amount) public {
            balances[user] += amount;
        }
        
        // Get balance
        function getBalance(address user) public view returns (uint) {
            return balances[user];
        }
        ```
        

---

3. **Message (`msg`)**
    - A complex data type specific to smart contracts.
    - Represents the function call invoked within a smart contract.
    - **Key Attributes:**
        - `msg.sender`: Address of the entity (user or contract) calling the function.
        - `msg.value`: Amount of Wei sent with the function call.
    - **Use Case Example:**
        
        ```solidity
        function deposit() public payable {
            require(msg.value > 0, "Must send some Ether");
            balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        }
        ```
        

---

### **Events in Solidity**

- **Purpose:**  
    Logs specific actions and sends data to external listeners (e.g., application-level listeners).
    
- **Definition:**  
    An event is defined with a set of parameters and invoked when specific conditions are met in the contract.
    
- **Example:**
    
    ```solidity
    event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount);
    
    function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[receiver] += amount;
        emit Sent(msg.sender, receiver, amount); // Logs the transfer event.
    }
    ```
    
- **Maximum Parameters:**  
    Events can accept up to **three parameters**.
    

---

### **Example: Coin Contract**

The `Coin` contract demonstrates the use of `address`, `mapping`, `msg`, and events.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Coin {
    address public minter; // Owner of the contract
    mapping(address => uint) public balances; // Mapping of addresses to balances

    event Sent(address from, address to, uint amount); // Event for logging transfers

    // Constructor: Initializes the contract and sets the minter
    constructor() {
        minter = msg.sender;
    }

    // Mint new coins (only the minter can mint)
    function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
        require(msg.sender == minter, "Only minter can mint coins");
        balances[receiver] += amount;
    }

    // Transfer coins to a specific address
    function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balances[receiver] += amount;
        emit Sent(msg.sender, receiver, amount); // Log the transaction
    }
}
```


---

### **Structs**

Structs are composite data types in Solidity used to group multiple variables into a single entity, which can be accessed collectively using a meaningful name.

- **Definition**:
    
    ```solidity
    struct Voter {
        uint weight;     // Weight of the vote
        bool voted;      // Whether the voter has voted
        uint vote;       // Index of the proposal they voted for
    }
    ```
    
- **Usage**:
    
    - Group related data logically.
    - Access individual attributes using the dot notation.
    - Example:
        
        ```solidity
        Voter memory voter = Voter(2, false, 0); // Create a voter
        voter.weight = 3;                        // Modify weight
        ```
        
- **Example in Context**: In the ballot smart contract:
    
    - `Voter` struct holds information about individual voters.
    - `Proposal` struct may hold details about a proposal:
        
        ```solidity
        struct Proposal {
            uint voteCount;   // Number of votes received
            string name;      // Proposal name
        }
        Proposal[] public proposals; // Array of proposals
        ```
        

---

### **Arrays**

Arrays are used to store collections of elements, such as a list of proposals in a voting system.

- **Types**:
    
    - **Fixed-size arrays**: Size is specified during declaration.
        
        ```solidity
        uint[3] fixedArray; // Array with exactly 3 elements
        ```
        
    - **Dynamic arrays**: Size can grow or shrink.
        
        ```solidity
        uint[] public dynamicArray;
        ```
        
- **Usage**:
    
    - Store and manage collections of elements.
    - Access using index notation (`array[index]`).
    - Example:
        
        ```solidity
        proposals.push(Proposal({voteCount: 0, name: "Proposal A"}));
        ```
        
- **Example in Context**: In the ballot smart contract:
    
    - An array of `Proposal` structs tracks the proposals being voted on.
    - Each element represents a proposal with attributes like name and vote count.

#### **Time Units in Solidity**

1. **Universal Time in Blockchain Applications**:
    
    - Blockchain networks use **Unix Epoch Time** (seconds since January 1, 1970) for synchronization among participants and nodes.
    - This timestamp is used for:
        - **Block timestamping**: Each block has a unique timestamp.
        - **Transaction confirmation time**: Transactions confirmed in a block share the block's timestamp.
2. **Solidity's `now` Variable**:
    
    - Represents the current block's timestamp.
    - **Important Note**: `now` refers to the block's confirmation time, **not** the initiation time of a transaction.
3. **Time Units in Solidity**:
    
    - Solidity supports intuitive time units for ease of calculation:
        - **Seconds**
        - **Minutes**
        - **Hours**
        - **Days**
        - **Weeks**
        - **Years**
    - Example: Specifying durations in contract logic:
        
        ```solidity
        uint startTime = now; // Current time
        uint oneDayLater = startTime + 1 days; // Add one day
        ```
        
4. **Example Use Case**:
    
    - **Voting Contract**:
        - Allocate time for registration (e.g., 1 day) and voting (e.g., 60 minutes).
        - Logic:
            - If `now > creationTime + 1 days`, registration ends.
            - If `now < voteStartTime + 60 minutes`, voting is allowed.
        - Demonstrates time-based state transitions.

---

#### **Enum Data Type in Solidity**

1. **Definition and Purpose**:
    
    - `enum` is a user-defined data type for specifying a limited set of meaningful values.
    - Commonly used for **internal contract logic**, such as representing states or phases in a smart contract.
    - Not yet supported at the **ABI (Application Binary Interface)** level.
2. **Enum Characteristics**:
    
    - Enums are **integer-based** under the hood:
        - Values are stored as `0`, `1`, `2`, etc.
        - Enum names (e.g., `Init`, `Reg`) are human-readable labels for these integers.
3. **Example: State Transitions with Enum and Time**:
    
    - Enum Definition:
        
        ```solidity
        enum Stage { Init, Reg, Vote, Done } // 0, 1, 2, 3
        Stage public stage; // Declare a variable of type Stage
        ```
        
    - Contract with Time-based State Transitions:
        
        ```solidity
        pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
        
        contract StateTransition {
            enum Stage { Init, Reg, Vote, Done }
            Stage public stage;
            uint public startTime;
        
            constructor() {
                stage = Stage.Init; // Initialize stage
                startTime = block.timestamp; // Set start time
            }
        
            function advanceState() public {
                if (block.timestamp >= startTime + 10 seconds && stage == Stage.Init) {
                    stage = Stage.Reg;
                } else if (block.timestamp >= startTime + 20 seconds && stage == Stage.Reg) {
                    stage = Stage.Vote;
                } else if (block.timestamp >= startTime + 30 seconds && stage == Stage.Vote) {
                    stage = Stage.Done;
                }
            }
        }
        ```
        
    - Key Observations:
        - Each stage transition is governed by elapsed time (`10 seconds` in the demo).
        - Use of `advanceState` ensures explicit transitions.

### **Practical Example: Ballot Smart Contract**

Here’s a simplified version of a ballot contract integrating **structs**, **arrays**, **enums**, and **time units**:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Ballot {
    struct Voter {
        uint weight;
        bool voted;
        uint vote;
    }

    struct Proposal {
        uint voteCount;
        string name;
    }

    enum Stage { Init, Reg, Vote, Done }
    Stage public stage;

    address public chairperson;
    mapping(address => Voter) public voters;
    Proposal[] public proposals;
    uint public startTime;

    constructor(string[] memory proposalNames) {
        chairperson = msg.sender;
        voters[chairperson].weight = 2; // Chairperson gets 2 votes
        stage = Stage.Init;
        startTime = block.timestamp;

        for (uint i = 0; i < proposalNames.length; i++) {
            proposals.push(Proposal({name: proposalNames[i], voteCount: 0}));
        }
    }

    function register(address voter) public {
        require(msg.sender == chairperson, "Only chairperson can register");
        require(stage == Stage.Reg, "Not in registration phase");
        require(!voters[voter].voted, "Already voted");

        voters[voter].weight = 1; // Assign 1 vote weight
    }

    function vote(uint proposalIndex) public {
        require(stage == Stage.Vote, "Not in voting phase");
        require(!voters[msg.sender].voted, "Already voted");

        voters[msg.sender].voted = true;
        proposals[proposalIndex].voteCount += voters[msg.sender].weight;
    }

    function winningProposal() public view returns (uint winningIndex) {
        uint maxVotes = 0;

        for (uint i = 0; i < proposals.length; i++) {
            if (proposals[i].voteCount > maxVotes) {
                maxVotes = proposals[i].voteCount;
                winningIndex = i;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# **Function Modifiers and Error Handling in Solidity**

---

#### **1. Function Modifiers**

Function modifiers are a powerful feature in Solidity used to add conditions to functions. They are executed before the main body of the function and can alter its behavior. A modifier is like a gatekeeper for a function—only allowing the function to execute if certain conditions are met.

- **Definition**:
    
    - A modifier is defined before the function and typically checks for conditions using `require` or `revert`. If the condition fails, the transaction is reverted, and no state changes occur.
- **Syntax**:
    
    ```solidity
    modifier onlyBy(address _address) {
        require(msg.sender == _address, "Not authorized");
        _;
    }
    ```
    
    - The `_;` acts as a placeholder for the body of the function that uses the modifier.
    - `onlyBy(address _address)` ensures that only a specific address (like the chairperson) can execute the function.
- **Usage**: Modifiers are used to manage access control or enforce preconditions for function execution.
    
- **Example**:
    
    ```solidity
    modifier onlyBy(address _address) {
        require(msg.sender == _address, "Not authorized");
        _;
    }
    
    function registerVoter(address _voter) public onlyBy(chairperson) {
        // function body for registering voters
    }
    ```
    

---

#### **2. The `require` Clause**

`require` is used to validate conditions before executing a function. If the condition fails, the transaction is reverted, and no changes are recorded on the blockchain.

- **Syntax**:
    
    ```solidity
    require(condition, "Error message");
    ```
    
- **Usage**:
    
    - Validates input values, function arguments, or state before execution.
    - Common use cases include input validation and ensuring proper contract state.
    - Reverts the transaction if the condition is not met.
- **Example**: In the ballot smart contract, you might use `require` to ensure that only the chairperson can register voters:
    
    ```solidity
    require(msg.sender == chairperson, "Only the chairperson can register voters");
    ```
    

---

#### **3. The `assert` Declaration**

`assert` is used to check post-conditions or invariants after the function executes. It is primarily used for internal consistency checks, and if the condition fails, it will revert the entire transaction.

- **Syntax**:
    
    ```solidity
    assert(condition);
    ```
    
- **Usage**:
    
    - `assert` is used to ensure that the internal state of the contract is as expected.
    - Typically, you would use it after the function's execution to confirm that the contract's state hasn't been corrupted.
- **Example**: In a betting contract, `assert` could be used to ensure that the bank's balance does not dip below a set reserve:
    
    ```solidity
    assert(bankBalance >= reserveAmount);
    ```
    

---

#### **4. Reverting a Transaction**

Reverting a transaction means canceling the changes made by the function, which also prevents any gas from being consumed.

- **Syntax**:
    
    ```solidity
    revert("Error message");
    ```
    
- **Usage**:
    
    - Reverts the entire transaction, returning any unused gas.
    - Useful for cases when input validation or condition checks fail.
- **Example**: If a buyer doesn't have enough funds to purchase an item, you can revert the transaction:
    
    ```solidity
    revert("Insufficient funds");
    ```
    

---

#### **5. Reward Function**

Reward functions are used to incentivize or compensate participants in a smart contract based on certain actions or conditions.

- **Usage**:
    
    - A reward function could be implemented to distribute tokens or funds to users after they successfully complete certain tasks.
- **Example**: A reward system for a betting contract could pay out the winner after validating the conditions:
    
    ```solidity
    function rewardWinner(address winner) public {
        require(isValidWinner(winner), "Invalid winner");
        payable(winner).transfer(prizeAmount);
    }
    ```
    

---

#### **6. Example of Combined Usage**

Let’s combine the concepts of **modifiers**, **require**, **assert**, and **revert** into a more complex contract scenario, such as an online marketplace.

- **Scenario**: A buyer can only buy items if there are at least 5 sellers, and their balance is sufficient. After the transaction, the system checks if the item was successfully transferred.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DigitalMarketplace {
    uint public sellerCount = 0;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    address public owner;

    modifier atLeast5Sellers() {
        require(sellerCount >= 5, "Not enough sellers");
        _;
    }

#### **7. Summary**

- **Modifiers** are used to enforce preconditions or postconditions before or after a function executes.
- **Require** checks conditions before execution and reverts the transaction if the condition is false.
- **Assert** is used to validate post-conditions or ensure contract invariants.
- **Revert** is used to cancel transactions when conditions are not met, saving gas.
- **Reward Functions** provide incentives or compensate participants based on actions.

Together, these features support robust error handling in Solidity smart contracts, ensuring that only valid transactions are executed and the contract's integrity is maintained.
