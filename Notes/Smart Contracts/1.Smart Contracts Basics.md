# **Smart Contracts**

#### **1. Introduction**

- Originated from **Nick Szabo’s 1996 publication**, where he introduced the term "Smart Contract" and proposed the idea of **Bit Gold**, a precursor to Bitcoin.
- Smart contracts are central to the **Ethereum blockchain**, enabling user-defined operations of arbitrary complexity.

---

#### **2. Evolution of Smart Contracts**

- Bitcoin introduced a **basic script** for conditional value transfer through a **soft fork**.
- Ethereum expanded this with a **working smart contract layer**:
    - Supports **arbitrary code execution** over the blockchain.
    - Provides enhanced functionality for decentralized applications (dApps).

---

#### **3. Features and Capabilities of Smart Contracts**

- Smart contracts serve as the **business logic layer** on the blockchain.
- They enable:
    - **Transfer of assets** other than cryptocurrency.
    - **Specification of rules and policies** for blockchain operations.
    - **Programmability and intelligence**, allowing complex applications to operate.
    - Transparent, decentralized operations without intermediaries (e.g., direct mortgage initiation without a bank).

---

#### **4. Advantages of Smart Contracts**

- `Transparency: `All transactions are recorded on the blockchain.
- `Automation:` Rules, regulations, and computations are encoded within the contract.
- `Decentralization:` Eliminates intermediaries in operations, e.g., payments, governance.
- `Flexibility:` Supports diverse applications, from supply chains to disaster recovery.

---

#### **5. Real-World Applications**

- **Examples**:
    - Automated gift delivery with date-specific rules.
    - Product purchases with quality and customization criteria.
    - Credential verification for license renewals.
    - Automated home mortgage initiation without intermediaries.
- **Potential**: Many blockchain applications leveraging smart contracts are yet to be conceived.

---

#### **6. Comparison: Bitcoin Transactions vs. Smart Contract Transactions**

- **Bitcoin**:
    - Focused on transferring value (currency).
    - Limited to simple conditional operations.
- **Smart Contracts**:
    - Transactions can embed complex functions, such as:
        - **ValidateVoter**
        - **Vote**
        - **Count**
        - **DeclareWinner**
    - Enables decentralized computation and logic execution on the blockchain.

---

#### **7. Development and Deployment**

- **Languages**: Smart contracts in Ethereum are written in **Solidity**, a high-level programming language.
- **Development Environment**:
    - Use **Remix IDE** (accessible via [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)).
    - Provides tools for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

## Defining Smart Contracts in Ethereum

### **Structure of a Smart Contract**

1. **Pragma Directive**:  
    Specifies the version of Solidity used, e.g., `pragma solidity ^0.8.7;`.
    
2. **Contract Declaration**:  
    Starts with the keyword `contract` followed by the contract's name, e.g., `contract Greeter`.
    
3. **State Variables**:
    
    - Used to store the contract's data persistently.
    - Example:
```
        `string public yourName;`
```

4. **Constructor**:
    
    - A special function called only once during contract deployment to initialize state variables.
    - Example:
         
```
        constructor() {     
	        yourName = "World"; 
	    }      
```
5. **Functions**:
    
    - Define the contract's behavior and logic.
    - Can be read-only (`view`) or modify the state.
    - Example:
```
        function set(string memory name) public {     
	        yourName = name; 
	    }
```

---

#### **Key Development Steps**

1. **Design**:  
    Plan the structure and logic of the smart contract, including variables, functions, and workflows.
    
2. **Code**:  
    Implement the design in Solidity using meaningful identifiers and camel case conventions.
    
3. **Test**:  
    Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like **Remix** to compile, deploy, and interact with the contract.
    

---

#### **Example: Greeter Contract(Greeter.sol)**

- **Purpose**: A simple contract that stores a name and greets the user.
- **Components**:
    - `yourName`: State variable to store the name.
    - Constructor: Initializes `yourName` to "World".
    - `set()`: Updates the `yourName` variable.
    - `hello()`: Returns the current value of `yourName`.

---

#### **Using Remix IDE**

- **URL**: [Remix Ethereum](https://remix.ethereum.org)
- **Features**:
    - **File Browser**: Manage contract files.
    - **Editor Window**: Write the smart contract code.
    - **Console/Output Window**: View execution results.
    - **Tool Panel**: Access tools for compiling, deploying, and debugging.

### Processing a Smart Contract

- A smart contract must be compiled before deployment.
- The compiler generates several artifacts essential for deploying, interacting with, and managing the contract on the blockchain.

---

### **Steps to Process a Smart Contract**

1. **Create the Smart Contract**:  
    Write the contract code in a high-level language like Solidity.
    
2. **Compile the Contract**:  
    Use a compiler (e.g., Remix Solidity Compiler) to process the contract. The output includes several key artifacts.
    
3. **Deploy the Contract**:  
    Deploy using:
    
    - Externally Owned Account (EOA) programmatically.
    - Command-line interface or scripts.
    - High-level applications or user interfaces (e.g., Remix IDE).
4. **Generate Address**:  
    The contract’s address is computed using the **hash of the account number** of the externally owned account (EOA) and the **nonce**.
    

---

#### **Artifacts Generated by the Compiler**

1. **Contract Name**:  
    The name of the smart contract.
    
2. **Metadata**:  
    Details about the contract’s structure and features.
    
3. **Bytecode**:
    
    - Executable code for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
    - Used to deploy the smart contract.
4. **Application Binary Interface (ABI)**:
    
    - Schema for interacting with the smart contract.
    - Specifies functions, parameters, and return values.
    - Used by web applications to invoke smart contract functions.
5. **Web3 Deploy Script**:
    
    - Contains scripts for deploying the contract programmatically.
    - Includes JSON data for interaction with web applications.
6. **Function Hashes**:
    
    - First 4 bytes of function signatures.
    - Facilitate function invocation via transactions.
7. **Gas Estimates**:
    
    - Predicts gas costs for deploying the contract.
    - Provides gas usage for individual function calls.
8. **Instance Bytecode**:
    
    - Bytecode specific to the deployed instance of the smart contract.
9. **Runtime Bytecode**:
    
    - Executable bytecode used after the contract is deployed.
10. **Assembly Code**:
    
    - Low-level representation of the bytecode.


- These artifacts are crucial for deploying and interacting with the smart contract programmatically or via web applications.

## Deploying Smart Contracts


### **Smart Contract Deployment Process**

1. **Write Smart Contract Code**:
    
    - Use a high-level language like Solidity.
2. **Compile the Code**:
    
    - The compiler generates **bytecode** and an **ABI (Application Binary Interface)**.
    - Bytecode: Executes on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
    - ABI: Provides a schema for high-level applications (e.g., web apps) to interact with the contract.
3. **Generate Contract Address**:
    
    - The address is computed by hashing the **creator’s account address** and its **nonce**.
    - If the target account address is `0x0` (null), the transaction is for creating a new smart contract.
4. **Deploy the Contract**:
    
    - The **payload** of the deployment transaction contains the smart contract bytecode.
    - The EVM executes the bytecode as part of the transaction, similar to a constructor creating an object.
    - Once executed, the bytecode is permanently stored on the blockchain.
5. **Validation and Propagation**:
    
    - The deployment transaction goes through regular blockchain validations, such as:
        - Signature verification.
        - Sufficient gas check.
        - Execution in a new block.
    - The deployed contract is replicated across all nodes in the Ethereum network.
6. **Execution Environment**:
    
    - The smart contract is executed consistently across all nodes, ensuring decentralized trust.

#### **Deployment Approaches**

- **Remix IDE**:
    
    - Simplified deployment interface for writing, compiling, deploying, and testing contracts.
    - Generates all necessary artifacts for deployment and interaction.
- **Other Methods**:
    
    - **From Another Smart Contract**: Contracts can deploy other contracts programmatically.
    - **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Use tools like `Truffle` or `Hardhat` for deployment.
    - **Web Applications**: Use libraries like `web3.js` or `ethers.js` to deploy and interact with contracts.
