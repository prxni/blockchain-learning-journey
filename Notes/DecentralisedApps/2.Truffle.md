# **Developing a Decentralized Application (DApp) Using Truffle**

## **Introduction**

In the last module, we covered the foundational concepts of decentralized applications (DApps). Now, we will build a complete DApp using **Truffle**, a comprehensive development environment for Ethereum-based applications.

## **Why Use Truffle?**

Truffle provides:

- ✅ A structured project template for DApp development
- ✅ A local blockchain for testing
- ✅ Tools for compiling, migrating, and testing smart contracts
- ✅ Easy interaction with the blockchain using Metamask and Web3

Instead of using **Remix IDE**, which is great for testing individual smart contracts, we will use **Truffle IDE** to assemble and deploy a full-fledged DApp.

# **Understanding the DApp Development Process**

To simplify learning, we will **reuse a problem from our smart contract course**—the **Ballot (Voting) DApp**.

## **Use Case: Voting DApp**

We will design a **DApp for voting** that allows users to choose among different options:

- 🟢 Selecting a leader in an election
- 🟢 Rating a product based on customer reviews
- 🟢 Passing a law in a governing body

For this module, we will **create a voting DApp that selects the most popular fruit** from four options.

## **Voting Rules**

1️⃣ Only the **chairperson** can register voters.  
2️⃣ A voter can be **registered only once**.  
3️⃣ Only **registered** voters can vote.  
4️⃣ Voters can **vote only once**.  
5️⃣ No write-in votes (voters can only select from given options).  
6️⃣ **Chairperson's vote** has **double weight**.

---

# **Steps to Build the Voting DApp**

## **Step 1: Design the Smart Contract (Ballot.sol)**

We define a **Ballot.sol** smart contract that handles voter registration and voting logic.

## **Step 2: Add Modifiers for Access Control**

Modifiers are used to enforce rules. We define **onlyChairperson** to restrict access to certain functions.

## **Step 3: Write Test Cases for the Contract**

Before deploying, we need to test the contract using Truffle’s test framework.

## **Step 4: Add a Front-End for User Interaction**

We will create a simple **React.js UI** to interact with the blockchain using **Web3.js**.

## **Step 5: Deploy and Test the Complete DApp**

### **Deploy Using Truffle**

```sh
truffle compile
truffle migrate --network development
truffle test
```

### **Run the Local Blockchain**

```sh
truffle develop
```

# **Getting Started with Truffle**

## **1. Setting Up Your Project**

### **Step 1: Install Truffle**

Ensure you have **Node.js** installed, then install Truffle globally:

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

### **Step 2: Create a Project Folder**

```bash
mkdir BallotDApp
cd BallotDApp
```

### **Step 3: Initialize Truffle**

```bash
truffle init
```

This creates the necessary files and folders for your Truffle project.

---

## **2. Understanding the Truffle Project Structure**

📂 **contracts/** → Store your smart contracts (Solidity files).  
📂 **migrations/** → Contains deployment scripts for smart contracts.  
📂 **test/** → Store test files for your contracts (written in JavaScript or Solidity).  
📄 **truffle-config.js** → Configuration file for specifying the blockchain network.

---

## **3. Writing a Smart Contract**

### **Step 1: Create the Contract**

Inside the `contracts/` folder, create a new file called `Ballot.sol`:

```bash
touch contracts/Ballot.sol
```

### **Step 2: Write the Contract Code**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

contract Ballot {
    struct Voter {
        uint weight;
        bool voted;
        uint8 vote;
    }

    struct Proposal {
        uint voteCount;
    }

    address chairperson;
    mapping(address => Voter) voters;
    Proposal[] proposals;

    constructor(uint8 _numProposals) {
        chairperson = msg.sender;
        voters[chairperson].weight = 2;
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < _numProposals; i++) {
            proposals.push(Proposal(0));
        }
    }

    function register(address toVoter) public {
        require(msg.sender == chairperson, "Only chairperson can register voters");
        require(!voters[toVoter].voted, "Voter already registered");
        voters[toVoter].weight = 1;
    }

    function vote(uint8 toProposal) public {
        Voter storage sender = voters[msg.sender];
        require(!sender.voted, "Already voted");
        require(toProposal < proposals.length, "Invalid proposal");
        sender.voted = true;
        sender.vote = toProposal;
        proposals[toProposal].voteCount += sender.weight;
    }

    function winningProposal() public view returns (uint8 _winningProposal) {
        uint256 winningVoteCount = 0;
        for (uint8 prop = 0; prop < proposals.length; prop++) {
            if (proposals[prop].voteCount > winningVoteCount) {
                winningVoteCount = proposals[prop].voteCount;
                _winningProposal = prop;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

---

## **4. Compiling and Deploying the Smart Contract**

### **Step 1: Compile the Contract**

```bash
truffle compile
```

### **Step 2: Deploy the Contract**

#### **Create a Deployment Script**

Inside the `migrations/` folder, create a new file:

```bash
touch migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js
```

#### **Write the Deployment Script**

```javascript
const Ballot = artifacts.require("Ballot");

module.exports = function (deployer) {
    deployer.deploy(Ballot, 4); // 4 proposals
};
```

#### **Deploy the Contract**

```bash
truffle migrate --reset
```

---

# **5. Using Truffle Console**

The Truffle console allows interaction with the blockchain:

```javascript
web3.eth.getAccounts() // Lists all accounts
web3.eth.getBalance(accounts[0]) // Checks balance
```

---

## **6. Summary**

✅ We designed and implemented a **voting DApp**.  
✅ We explored **Truffle IDE** commands for DApp development.  
✅ We deployed a smart contract on a **test blockchain**.  
✅ Next, we will **test the smart contract**.

This guide ensures a structured and comprehensible approach to DApp development using Truffle. 🚀 Let me know if you need further clarifications!
