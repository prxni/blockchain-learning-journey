# DApp (Decentralized Application)

- A DApp is an end-to-end application running on a blockchain.
 - It allows people, applications, and systems (even unknown to each other) to transact peer-to-peer.
- DApps expose blockchain services to the world for review, interaction, and use.

### DApp Architecture:

1. **Core Components:**
    - **Client Interface:**
        - Examples: Web apps, mobile apps, command-line interfaces (CLI), IoT devices.
    - **Back-End:**
        - Includes the blockchain and smart contracts.
2. **Similar to Web Architecture:**
    - Like a web browser and server but with a decentralized infrastructure hosted by peer participants.
3. **Integration with Smart Contracts:**
    - Smart contracts handle the logic; the front-end interacts with these via artifacts generated during compilation.

## **DApp Development Roadmap:**

1. **Learning Path:**
    
    - Understand blockchain servers, APIs, and DApp architecture.
    - Use tools like Truffle IDE to incrementally develop a DApp.
    - Explore best practices for smart contract design.
    - Study standards to ensure predictable DApp behavior.
2. **Hands-On Development:**
    
    - Create a blockchain node using `geth` (Ethereum client).
    - Set up a genesis block (the first block of the blockchain).
    - Establish a private blockchain network and add peer nodes.

## **Best Practices for DApps:**

1. **Develop on Local Networks:**
    
    - Test DApps on private or test networks before deploying them publicly.
    - Examples of public network IDs:
        - Ethereum Mainnet: 
        - Ropsten Testnet: 
        - Rinkeby Testnet: 
2. **Peer-to-Peer Networking:**
    
    - Blockchain operates on a decentralized, peer-to-peer network of nodes.
    - Nodes connect using the `enode` address and specific ports.

#### **Blockchain Server Overview:**

1. **Concept of Blockchain Server:**
    - Provides the infrastructure and functionality for blockchain operations.
    - Includes the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for executing smart contracts.
2. **Node Creation:**
    - Start with a genesis node (Node 0) using `geth`.
    - Add more nodes as peers to form a network.

# API

- **Definition**:
    - An **Application Programming Interface (API)** is a structured, standardized set of functions and methods that enable applications to interact with datasets and services.
    - It allows developers to invoke operations, access, or store data programmatically.
- **Features**:
    1. Promotes **code reusability**.
    2. Publishes a set of functions or methods for standardized access.
    3. Access control is often implemented (e.g., public keys).
- **Examples in the non-blockchain world**:
    - **Twitter API**: Retrieve tweets filtered by specific query terms.
    - **Google Maps API**: Integrate geolocation and map functionalities in apps.

### **Why are APIs important in Blockchain and Dapps?**

1. **Core Blockchain Functionality**:
    
    - Blockchain nodes and servers provide the infrastructure for decentralized operations.
    - APIs act as an intermediary to utilize blockchain services programmatically.
2. **Dapp Development**:

        - Account creation.
        - Mining.
        - Transaction management.
    - Example:
        - `miner.start()`:
            - `miner` → The API.
            - `start()` → The function of the API.
3. **APIs and the Blockchain Ecosystem**:
    
    - Blockchain encourages a **developer-driven culture** where contributors:
        - Build software.
        - Propose improvements to protocols.
        - Help with governance.

## **Ethereum APIs**

Ethereum provides two broad categories of APIs:

### **1. Management APIs**

Designed to manage and interact with the **Geth node**, these APIs help developers control and configure the Ethereum client.

- **Admin API**:
    
    - Functions for managing network peers and RPC endpoints.
    - Examples:
        - `admin.addPeer()`: Adds a peer to the node's network.
        - `admin.nodeInfo()`: Retrieves information about the current node.
- **Debug API**:
    
    - Useful for debugging and studying blockchain data.
    - Example:
        - `debug.dumpBlock(16)`: Displays block header details of block 16 for analysis.
- **Miner API**:
    
    - Controls mining operations.
    - Examples:
        - `miner.start()`: Starts the miner.
        - `miner.stop()`: Stops the miner.
        - `miner.start(6)`: Starts mining using 6 parallel threads.
- **Personal API**:
    
    - Manages accounts and private keys stored in the node.
    - Examples:
        - `personal.newAccount()`: Creates a new account.
        - `personal.unlockAccount()`: Unlocks an account for use.
- **Txpool API**:
    
    - Accesses and inspects the transaction pool, which holds:
        - Pending transactions (awaiting validation).
        - Queued transactions (waiting for future processing).
    - Example:
        - `txpool.inspect()`: Lists all pending transactions.

### **2. Web3 APIs**

These APIs are designed for **Dapp development** and provide interaction between the frontend and the Ethereum blockchain.

- **Web3.js Library**:
    
    - A JavaScript library specifically designed for:
        - Dapps.
        - Communication with local Ethereum nodes via RPC.
    - **Key Objects**:
        - `web3.eth`: Contains methods for blockchain interaction, such as sending transactions and retrieving account balances.
        - `web3.net`: Provides methods for network information (e.g., peer count).
        - `web3.ssh`: Implements the Whisper protocol for secure communication.
- **Features**:
    
    1. Interfaces with Ethereum nodes and Smart Contracts.
    2. Enables operations like:
        - **Smart Contract Deployment**: Deploy code to the blockchain.
        - **Function Invocation**: Call Smart Contract functions from the Dapp.
    3. Requests are formatted in **JSON-RPC** for interaction with the node.

---

### **Architecture of a Dapp Using APIs**

1. **Components**:
    
    - Multiple blockchain nodes (e.g., Node 1, Node 2).
    - A frontend (web client) using the **web3.js** library.
    - A backend (blockchain node) accessed via RPC ports.
2. **Workflow**:
    
    - The **Geth client** exposes an RPC endpoint using commands like `geth --rpc`.
    - A **web3 object** is instantiated in the Dapp's frontend script.
    - Requests from the web3 object are sent via JSON-RPC to the Geth node.
    - The Geth node executes the request using the relevant API or Smart Contract code.
    - Results are returned to the web client.
