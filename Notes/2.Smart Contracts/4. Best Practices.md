# **When to Use Blockchain**

- Blockchain is not a solution for all problems.
- Suitable for applications with the following characteristics:
    - **Decentralization**: Assets and participants are distributed, not co-located.
    - **Peer-to-Peer Transactions**: Eliminates intermediaries.
    - **Trustless Operations**: Operates among unknown participants without requiring trust.
    - **Validation and Recording**: Requires a universally timestamped, immutable ledger for validation, verification, and recording.
    - **Autonomous Operations**: Operates under predefined rules, regulations, or policies.

## **When to Use Smart Contracts**

- Use smart contracts for:
    - Enforcing collective agreements based on rules, policies, or governance.
    - Recording decisions and their provenance on the blockchain.
- Avoid smart contracts for:
    - Single-node computations.
    - Replacing client-server systems or inherently stateless distributed solutions.

## **Design Principles for Smart Contracts**

- **Simplicity**:
    - Keep the code simple, focused, and auditable.
    - Address a single problem effectively to minimize design and coding errors.
- **Efficiency**:
    - Store only necessary data on the blockchain.
    - Use state variables efficiently for on-chain data.
    - Offload large or redundant data (e.g., entire documents) to off-chain systems, storing only metadata or secure hashes on the blockchain.
- **Auditability**:
    - Use custom function modifiers for preconditions and postconditions instead of inline `if-else` logic.

## **On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Data**

- **On-Chain Data**:
    - Keep critical, immutable data that requires blockchain validation and recording.
- **Off-Chain Data**:
    - Manage larger, auxiliary data (e.g., detailed documents) in higher-level applications.
    - Store only essential metadata or hashes on the blockchain to ensure integrity and validation.

## **Best Practices for Solidity Smart Contracts**

- Use appropriate **visibility modifiers** (e.g., `public`, `private`, `internal`, `external`) for functions and variables to control access.
- Use **access modifiers** to enforce rules about who can invoke specific functions (e.g., `onlyOwner`, `onlyAdmin`).
- Avoid redundant or unrelated functions in the contract.
- Focus on efficient state transitions and storage to reduce gas costs.

## **Best Practices for Remix IDE**

- Leverage Remix IDE for:
    - Debugging and testing smart contracts before deployment.
    - Identifying and fixing common issues using static analysis tools.
    - Auditing contracts for potential vulnerabilities.

## **Example Application**

- Instead of storing an entire 500-page legal document on-chain:
    - Store metadata about the document (e.g., title, version, date).
    - Include a secure hash of the document to verify its integrity.

## **Key Takeaways**

- Blockchain and smart contracts are powerful tools, but they must be used appropriately.
- Design with simplicity, efficiency, and auditability in mind.
- Carefully separate on-chain and off-chain responsibilities to optimize storage and performance.

# Best Practices for Solidity Smart Contracts

#### **1. Use Efficient Data Types**

- The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is a 256-bit processor optimized for integer computations.
- Avoid dynamic-sized variables like strings in contracts (e.g., `string proposalName` is expensive).
    - **Alternative**: Use integer IDs for proposals and map them to names off-chain.
- Use integer arithmetic (`uint256`, `uint8`, etc.) for most computations to optimize storage and performance.

---

#### **2. Visibility Modifiers for Variables**

- **Private by Default**: All state variables are private by default but viewable on-chain.
- **Public Modifier**:
    - Explicitly declare variables as `public` to auto-generate a getter method.
    - Internally: Access variable directly as `data`.
    - Externally: Access through the auto-generated getter function.

---

#### **3. Function Order in Contracts**

Follow the recommended order for functions:

1. Constructor
2. Fallback function
3. External
4. Public
5. Internal
6. Private
7. Place **constant functions** last in each group.

---

#### **4. Using Function Modifiers**

- Use **visibility modifiers** first (e.g., `public`, `private`).
- Add **custom access modifiers** next (e.g., `onlyOwner`).
- Apply multiple modifiers in the correct order when dependencies exist.

**Example**:  
`function buy() public payable onlyOwner itemAvailable {}`

---

#### **5. Payable Functions**

- Use the `payable` modifier for functions that transfer value between accounts.
- **Examples**: Functions like `deposit`, `register`, or `bid` should be `payable` to allow sending Ether.

---

#### **6. Statement Order in Functions**

- Check conditions **before** executing critical logic.
- Example:
    - Correct: `require(condition); // then execute logic`
    - Incorrect: `execute logic; // then check condition`

**Why It Matters**: The Parity Wallet bug caused millions in losses because of improper ordering, allowing the contract to be killed before funds were moved.

---

#### **7. Modifier Declarations for Rules**

- Use custom modifiers to enforce:
    - Rules, policies, and regulations.
    - Common conditions (e.g., access control or validation).
- Enhances code readability and makes the contract auditable.

---

#### **8. Use Events for Logging**

- Use **events** to log significant milestones during contract execution.
- Benefits:
    - Push information to client applications with listeners.
    - Avoid polling by external applications.
- Events support up to **three indexed parameters** for efficient searching.

---

#### **9. Avoid "Now" for Precise Time**

- `now` is an alias for `block.timestamp`:
    - Accurate only to seconds.
    - Useful for elapsed time comparison but unreliable for precise time-sensitive logic.
- For fine-grained timing, use external mechanisms.

---

#### **10. Secure Hashing**

- Use hashing to secure sensitive data since blockchain data is visible to all.
- Solidity provides built-in hash functions:
    - `keccak256` (default in Ethereum)
    - `SHA-256`
    - `RIPEMD-160`

# Best Practices for Remix 

1. **Dynamic Updates:**
    
    - Remix IDE frequently updates with new features and improvements. Stay updated with changes to maximize its utility.
2. **Static Analysis Warnings:**
    
    - Pay attention to the static analysis tool in Remix.
    - It flags potential issues (e.g., use of the `now` time variable).
    - These warnings help improve code quality and avoid common pitfalls.
3. **Console Details and Debugging:**
    
    - The Remix console provides valuable details for debugging.
    - Errors are flagged in real-time as you type, allowing immediate corrections.
    - Post-compilation, you can click the “Details” button to view all compiler-generated artifacts.
4. **Transaction Logs:**
    
    - Use the transaction log panel (floppy disk icon) to view the JSON representation of executed transactions.
    - Save and analyze the logs for debugging runtime issues and reviewing transaction details.
