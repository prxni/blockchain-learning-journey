# Accessing External Resources in Smart Contracts

## Overview

Smart contracts operate in a sandbox environment, meaning they cannot directly access external resources. This limitation ensures the global consistency of the blockchain and keeps all operations deterministic. However, real-world applications often require external data, such as weather conditions or stock market prices. To solve this problem, we use **Oraclize**.

## What is Oraclize?

Oraclize acts as a **data carrier** between external web resources (APIs, URLs) and smart contracts. While Oraclize itself operates outside the blockchain protocol, it plays a crucial role in bringing real-world data to decentralized applications (dApps).

### Why Do We Need Oraclize?

Smart contracts cannot directly fetch data from external sources because:

1. The blockchain must remain **deterministic**.
    
2. External data sources can change, affecting the **consistency** of transactions.
    
3. Some required data (e.g., stock prices, weather updates) is not available at contract deployment time.
    

## How Oraclize Works

Oraclize enables smart contracts to access external data in a **secure and verifiable** way using a dedicated contract called **UsingOraclize**.

### Example Use Cases

- Fetching **weather data** (e.g., temperature on Mount Kilimanjaro on a given day).
    
- Retrieving **stock market data** (e.g., high/low price of a stock on NASDAQ).
    

### Steps to Use Oraclize

1. **Import the Oraclize Smart Contract**
    
    ```solidity
    import "usingOraclize.sol";
    ```
    
2. **Inherit the `UsingOraclize` contract**
    
    ```solidity
    contract AverageWinterTemperature is UsingOraclize {
    ```
    
3. **Use `oraclize_query` to fetch data**
    
    ```solidity
    oraclize_query("URL", "https://api.weather.com/temp");
    ```
    
4. **Handle the response via a callback function**
    
    ```solidity
    function __callback(bytes32 myid, string result) public {
        require(msg.sender == oraclize_cbAddress());
        temperature = result;
    }
    ```
    

### Execution Flow

1. The smart contract calls `fetchData()`, which invokes `oraclize_query()` with the target URL.
    
2. Oraclize fetches the data and authenticates the source.
    
3. The retrieved data is sent back to the smart contract via a **callback function**.
    
4. The smart contract processes the received data.
    

## Best Practices in dApp Development

1. **Efficient Memory Usage** - Optimize between **memory** and **storage** to reduce gas costs.
    
2. **Event Logging** - Helps with asynchronous operations and improves efficiency.
    
3. **Accessing External Data** - Essential for practical dApps requiring real-world information.
    

By incorporating these best practices, developers can improve the functionality and efficiency of their smart contracts and decentralized applications.
