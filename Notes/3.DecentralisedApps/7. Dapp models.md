# **Dapp Models and Their Evolution**

## **Introduction**

- This module explores different Dapp models and their ecosystems.
    
- Encourages thinking about new and disruptive application models.
    
- Discusses Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIP) and Ethereum Requests for Comments (ERC) frameworks.
    
- Explores the importance of standards in decentralized systems.
    
- Covers standard tokens: **ERC-20** and **ERC-721**.
    

## **Hierarchy of Dapp Models**

- The evolution of Dapps from cryptocurrencies to crypto-assets is explored using a **hierarchy diagram**.

- The diagram is not exhaustive but provides a high-level view.
    

## **Bitcoin - The First Cryptocurrency**

- Bitcoin is a **pure cryptocurrency** where every Bitcoin was minted by the protocol.
    
- Introduced the **decentralized payment system**, still operational but facing scalability and price volatility issues.
    

## **Coins and Initial Coin Offerings (ICO)**

- Bitcoin's **open-source** nature led to many new cryptocurrencies.
    
- **Ethereum Smart Contracts** enabled automated crowdfunding through **ICOs**.
    
- ICOs function similarly to **Initial Public Offerings (IPOs)** in traditional finance.
    
- ICOs use **blockchains** for:
    
    - Recording coin distribution.
        
    - Receiving funds.
        
    - Enforcing policies (e.g., restrictions on investments from certain countries).
        
- Examples: **Ethereum, Zcash**
    
    - **Ethereum** used ICO for initial funding.
        
    - **Zcash** focused on **privacy** and used a **closed-code** model.
        

## **Tokens and Initial Token Offerings (ITO)**

- **Difference between Coins and Tokens**:
    
    - **Coins** function as currencies.
        
    - **Tokens** represent assets or utilities.
        
- Example: **CryptoKitties**
    
    - Uses **tokens** to represent virtual cats.
        
    - **Immutable smart contracts** manage breeding and lifecycle.
        
    - Tokens are **non-fungible (NFTs)**—value changes over time.
        
- Example: **Augur**
    
    - A **prediction market Dapp** using crowd wisdom.
        
    - Participants earn **REP tokens** (Reputation Tokens).
        
    - REP holders receive transaction fees if their reports are accurate.
        
- Tokens are built on **Ethereum standards**:
    
    - **ERC-20** (fungible tokens)
        
    - **ERC-721** (non-fungible tokens, NFTs)
        

## **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO)**

- **DAO** is an early **Dapp innovation**, acting as an **autonomous venture capital fund**.
    
- Designed for **decentralized, anonymous fundraising** and **automated investing**.
    
- **DAO Hack & Ethereum Hard Fork (2016)**
    
    - A **vulnerability** in the DAO smart contract led to a **hacker exploit**.
        
    - Large amounts of **Ethereum were stolen**.
        
    - Resulted in the **Ethereum hard fork**, creating:
        
        - **Ethereum (ETH)** – fixed version.
            
        - **Ethereum Classic (ETC)** – still has the DAO bug.
            
- Despite its failure, DAOs remain a **promising Dapp model** if implemented securely.
    



# **Decentralized Marketplace Dapp**

- A decentralized marketplace is a fundamental Dapp model.
    
- It broadly covers areas from selling goods to credentialing in education.
    
- A marketplace serves as a platform where decentralized buyers and sellers (who are unknown to each other) can meet and exchange items.
    
- Payments and transactions are recorded on blockchain networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
    
- Bitcoin can be used as a global payment system for a decentralized marketplace.
    

## **Smart Contract Support for Buying and Selling**

- Smart contracts can facilitate transactions in decentralized marketplaces.
    
- An example of a smart contract for purchases is the "Safe Remote Purchase" contract available in Solidity documentation (purchase.sol).
    

## **FinTech Dapps**

- **Definition**: FinTech (Financial Technology) Dapps offer innovative solutions for financial services.
    
- Applications range from:
    
    - Decentralized investment instruments
        
    - Micropayment channels
        

## **4. Challenges in FinTech Dapps**

- **Transaction Confirmation Times**:
    
    - Decentralized systems have longer confirmation times compared to centralized stock trading systems, which can achieve sub-second confirmation.
        
- **Scalability Issues**:
    
    - Scaling solutions are needed to improve transaction speeds and efficiency.
        
- **Privacy Concerns**:
    
    - Financial transactions require confidentiality, which blockchain’s transparency can sometimes challenge.
        
- **Regulatory Challenges**:
    
    - Organizations like the US SEC and their counterparts in other countries impose policies affecting FinTech Dapps.
        
- **Security & Fraud Prevention**:
    
    - Strong security measures are needed to prevent fraud and maintain trust in the ecosystem.
        

### **Cryptocurrency & Investment Dapps**

- Tokens, coins, and ICO (Initial Coin Offering) Dapps allow investors and financial institutions to enter cryptocurrency markets.
    
- These Dapps serve as an entry point for both individual and institutional investors.
    

### **Future Potential of Dapp Models**

- Many innovative Dapp models are yet to be created.
    
- Just as Uber and Airbnb emerged long after the Internet's inception, new Dapp ideas will continue to evolve.
    
- The discussed models provide inspiration and guidelines for building new Dapps in different domains.
