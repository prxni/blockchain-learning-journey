## **What is Blockchain?**

- A technology enabling **peer-to-peer (P2P)** transfer of digital assets without intermediaries.
- Originally created to support **Bitcoin**, a cryptocurrency.
- Functions as a **decentralized network** with an **immutable distributed ledger** that ensures transparency and trust.

### **Why is Blockchain Important?**

- It eliminates the need for centralized authorities, fostering **direct transactions**.
- Applications span industries like:
    - **Finance**: Secure transactions without banks.
    - **Healthcare**: Managing patient records.
    - **Supply Chain**: Tracking goods transfer.
    - **Digital Media**: Art sales and copyright management.
    - **Education**: Credential verification.
    - **Government**: Public records and voting systems.

### **How Blockchain Works**

1. **Decentralization**:
    - Functions of intermediaries are replaced by the network participants.
2. **Trust Mechanisms**:
    - Achieved through **validation**, **verification**, and **consensus protocols**.
3. **Immutable Ledger**:
    - Transactions are recorded permanently, preventing tampering.

### **Key Concepts Illustrated**

1. **Centralized vs. Decentralized Systems**:
    
    - In centralized systems (e.g., credit cards), multiple intermediaries are involved.
    - Blockchain allows **direct transactions** between peers, reducing complexity.
2. **Immutable Ledger**:
    
    - Example: If one party tries to alter a transaction, others in the network reject the invalid change.
3. **Verification & Validation**:
    
    - Every transaction is checked and agreed upon by network participants.
    - Ensures collective trust, even among unknown peers.

### **Major Contributions of Bitcoin**

- A continuously working **digital currency system**.
- Introduced the model for **autonomous decentralized applications** via blockchain.


### **Core Features of Blockchain**

1. **Peer-to-Peer Transactions**.
2. **Decentralized Trust** through consensus.
3. **Immutable Records**: A tamper-proof chain of blocks.
4. **Scalability**: Handles millions of transactions efficiently.

### **Opportunities in Blockchain**

- **Innovation**: Endless possibilities for applications (e.g., crowdfunding, identity management).
- **Inclusion**: Supports participation in global democratic processes.
- **Need for Expertise**: Developers, designers, and critical thinkers are essential to expanding blockchain applications.

## **Structure of a Blockchain**

1. **Transaction**:
    
    - Basic unit of the Bitcoin Blockchain.
    - Transactions are validated and broadcast to the network.
2. **Block**:
    
    - Composed of multiple transactions.
    - Blocks are linked to form a **chain** through a **digital data link**.
3. **Consensus Process**:
    
    - Determines the next block to be added.
    - Carried out by **miners**, powerful computers executing blockchain protocols.
4. **Chain**:
    
    - Verified blocks are added sequentially to form an **immutable chain**.

### **Bitcoin Transactions**

- Based on **Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs)**:
    - UTXOs represent the current state of the Bitcoin Blockchain.
    - UTXOs act as inputs and outputs for transactions.

#### **How Transactions Work**:

1. **Inputs**:
    - Refer to existing UTXOs.
2. **Outputs**:
    - Newly created UTXOs after the transaction.
3. **Validation**:
    - Ensures referenced UTXOs exist and are valid.

#### **Structure of a UTXO**:

- **Unique Identifier**: Transaction that created it.
- **Index**: Position in the output list.
- **Value**: Amount it represents.
- **Optional Script**: Conditions for spending.

#### **Transaction Components**:

- Reference to input UTXOs.
- Creation of output UTXOs.
- Total input and output amounts.

## **Blocks in the Blockchain**

1. **Block Components**:
    
    - **Header**: Contains metadata like the block hash and previous block hash.
    - **Transactions**: Validated transactions within the block.
2. **Genesis Block**:
    
    - The first block, created on **January 3, 2009**, by Satoshi Nakamoto.
    - Reward: 50 BTC.
    - No previous block (field is all zeros).
    ![[Pasted image 20250113120414.png]]
1. **Recent Blocks**:
    
    - Each block links to the previous block via its hash.
    - Example:
        - Block **488868** references hash of block **488867**.
        - Block **488869** references hash of block **488868**.

## **Blockchain Operations**

### **1. Blockchain Operations Overview**

- Managed by **peer participants** and their computational devices (laptops, desktops, servers).
- ![[Pasted image 20250113125416.png]]
- Core operations:
    1. Validating transactions.
    2. Gathering transactions into a block.
    3. Broadcasting transactions and blocks.
    4. Reaching consensus on the next block.
    5. Chaining blocks to create an immutable record.

---

### **2. Participants and Roles**

- **Regular Participants**:
    - Initiate value transfer by creating transactions.
- **Miners**:
    - Perform additional work, including:
        - Verifying transactions.
        - Broadcasting transactions.
        - Competing to create the next block.
        - Validating and broadcasting the newly created block.
        - Confirming transactions.

---

### **3. Transaction Validation**

- **Criteria for Validation**:
    1. Referenced input UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) are valid.
    2. Reference output UTXOs are correct.
    3. Input and output amounts are sufficient and match.
    4. Invalid transactions are rejected and not broadcast.
- **Valid Transactions**:
    - Added to a pool, from which miners select transactions to form a block.

---

### **4. Block Creation**

- **Challenge**: If every miner adds a block, it causes branching and inconsistency.
- **Solution**:
    - Miners solve a **computational puzzle** to earn the right to create the next block.
    - Puzzle: CPU-intensive problem (Proof-of-Work).

---

### **5. Proof-of-Work and Consensus**

- **Steps**:
    1. Miners solve the puzzle.
    2. Broadcast the solution and the new block to the network.
    3. Participants verify the new block.
    4. Consensus is reached to add the block to the chain.
- **Result**:
    - Transactions in the block are recorded and confirmed.

---

### **6. Coinbase Transaction**

- **Special Transaction** in a new block:
    - Created by the miner.
    - Generates the miner’s reward (no input UTXOs).
    - Current reward: **12.5 BTC**.
    - This process **mints new Bitcoin**.
