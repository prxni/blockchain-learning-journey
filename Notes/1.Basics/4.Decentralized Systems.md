# **Trust in Centralized vs. Decentralized Systems**

## Centralized Trust: An Airport Scenario

- At a centralized airport system, **trust** is established through various layers:
    1. The **airport authority** sets up a secure environment for arrivals and departures.
    2. **Passenger credentials** (passport, tickets) are verified and validated.
    3. **Security screening** ensures compliance.
    4. **Boarding pass checks** by airline staff confirm final trust before flight boarding.

## Decentralized Trust: Blockchain

- In a decentralized system, there is no centralized authority verifying trust. Instead, **algorithms and cryptographic techniques** establish trust:
    - Transactions and blocks are **validated** for tampering.
    - Resources for transactions are **verified**.
    - The network reaches **consensus** to finalize blocks.

---

## **The Trust Trail in Blockchain**

Trust in blockchain is established by following these sequential steps:
	
1. **Validate the Transaction**:
    
    - Transactions are checked for validity based on specific criteria.
        
    - In Bitcoin, around **20 validation checks** are performed, such as:
        
        - Syntax checks.
        - Validating the **transaction signature**.
        - Ensuring the **timestamp** and **nonce** are correct.
    - In Ethereum, validations include:
        
        - Transaction **syntax**.
        - Verifying **gas limit** and sender's **account balance**.
        - Ensuring the **transaction signature** and hash are correct.
2. **Verify Resources**:
    
    - For Ethereum, the availability of **gas points** (used as fuel for smart contract execution) and other resources is confirmed.

3. **Execute Transactions**:
    
    - Validated transactions are processed to produce:
        - **Transaction root**: A Merkle tree hash of all validated transactions, stored in the block header.
        - **State root**: The Merkle tree hash of the resulting blockchain state after executing transactions and smart contracts.
        - **Receipt root**: A hash representing the outcomes of the executed transactions.

---

## **Merkle Trees and Trust**

Merkle trees ensure efficient trust-building by:

- Organizing transaction hashes into a tree structure.
- Allowing quick detection of tampering by verifying only one path in the tree instead of all transactions.
- Computing state transitions efficiently:
    - If a small change occurs in the state, only the affected paths are recalculated.

---

## **Consensus Process (Next Step in the Trust Trail)**

- After validating and executing transactions, the next step is achieving **consensus**. This ensures that:
    - All nodes agree on the validity of the block.
    - The finalized block is added to the blockchain.

---
Trust in blockchain is established using:

1. **Validation**: Transactions and blocks are thoroughly checked for tampering and correctness.
2. **Verification**: Resources, such as gas points and signatures, are verified.
3. **Execution**: Transactions are executed, and their results are hashed using Merkle trees.
4. **Consensus**: Ensures the network agrees on the next block.

Blockchain systems achieve trust through `cryptography` and `consensus algorithms`, eliminating the need for centralized authorities.

---
# **Secure Chain and Trust**

- A **secure chain** is the main chain with a consistent and immutable state.
- Every valid block added to the chain increases its **trust level**.
- Miners compete to add their **candidate blocks** to this chain. The question arises: **How do miners agree on the next block to be added?**
- This agreement is achieved using a **consensus protocol**. One of the most widely used protocols is **Proof of Work (PoW)**.

---

### **What is Proof of Work (PoW)?**

PoW is a consensus mechanism that:

1. Ensures agreement among miners on the next block to be added to the blockchain.
2. Relies heavily on **hashing** (a cryptographic function).

---

### **How PoW Works (From a Miner's Perspective)**

1. **Prepare the Block**:
    
    - The miner prepares the **block header**, which contains elements such as the **transaction root, timestamp, previous block hash**, and a **nonce** (a random value).
2. **Compute the Hash**:
    
    - The miner computes the hash of the block header using a cryptographic hashing algorithm like SHA-256 (Bitcoin) or Keccak (Ethereum).
    - The hash value is compared against a **target value**:
        - For Bitcoin: The target is **2^128**.
        - For Ethereum: The target is a **function of the network difficulty**.
    ![[Pasted image 20250115112338.png]]
3. **Adjust the Nonce**:
    
    - If the computed hash is **not less than the target**, the miner adjusts the nonce and recomputes the hash. This process is repeated until the hash meets the required target.
4. **Broadcast the Winning Block**:
    
    - When a miner finds a hash that satisfies the condition (i.e., solves the puzzle), they broadcast their **winning block** to the network.
    - Other miners verify the block's validity.
5. **Consensus and Incentive**:
    
    - Once the block is verified, it is added to the blockchain.
    - The miner who solved the puzzle receives a **reward** (e.g., newly minted cryptocurrency or transaction fees).
    - Non-winning miners move on to work on the next block.

---

### **Why Use Proof of Work?**

- PoW ensures that adding a new block requires **computational effort**, making it difficult for attackers to tamper with the blockchain.
- It leverages the decentralized nature of the blockchain to ensure **trust** without a central authority.

---

### **Comparison: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum (PoW Differences)**

- **Bitcoin**: Uses SHA-256 for hashing, with a fixed target (2^128).
- **Ethereum**: Uses Keccak hashing, with a target that adjusts based on network difficulty.

---

### **Alternatives to Proof of Work**

- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Instead of computational power, validators lock up cryptocurrency (stake) to propose and validate blocks.
- **Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)**: Nodes compete for block creation based on a random wait time.

These alternatives aim to reduce the high energy consumption of PoW and are actively debated in the blockchain community.

# Robustness in Blockchain**

- **Trust** in blockchain extends beyond regular operations to managing **exceptional situations** satisfactorily.
- **Robustness** refers to a blockchain's ability to handle these exceptional cases effectively in a decentralized network without intermediaries.

Two key exceptions discussed:

1. **Chain Splits (Forks)**
2. **Double Spending**

---

## **1. Chain Splits (Forks)**

#### **Scenario**:

- Multiple miners solve the consensus puzzle almost simultaneously.
- This results in two competing chains (a **chain split**).

#### **Bitcoin's Approach**:

1. The chain splits temporarily, creating **two competing chains** led by each miner's block.
    
2. The probability of the next block being added simultaneously to both chains is **very low**.
    
3. The longer chain (i.e., the one that gets the next valid block) becomes the **main chain**.
    
4. The blocks from the rejected chain are sent back to the **unconfirmed transaction pool**.
    
    **Key Point**: Bitcoin resolves splits within a cycle, ensuring there’s always a **single valid chain**.
    

#### **Ethereum's Approach**:

1. Ethereum allows **Uncle (or Runner-Up) blocks** to incentivize miners whose blocks didn't make it to the main chain.
    
2. These **Runner-Up blocks** are recorded but are not part of the main chain.
    
3. Small incentives are given to miners for contributing these blocks.
    
4. The Runner-Up blocks are **maintained for six more blocks** before being discarded.
    
    **Key Point**: Ethereum rewards miners for contributing even if their blocks don't win, which increases security and decentralization.
    

---

### **2. Double Spending**

#### **Scenario**:

- A digital asset (e.g., cryptocurrency) is referenced in multiple transactions, either intentionally or inadvertently.
- This is akin to an **airline double-booking a seat on a flight**.

#### **Bitcoin's Approach**:

- The first transaction referencing a digital asset is **accepted**, and all subsequent transactions using the same asset are **rejected**.

#### **Ethereum's Approach**:

- Ethereum uses a combination of an **account number** and a **global nonce**:
    1. Each transaction includes a **global nonce** (a unique number tied to the account).
    2. The nonce is **incremented** after each transaction.
    3. This ensures that every transaction has a unique identifier, preventing double spending.

---

### **Importance of Handling Exceptions**

- These well-defined processes enhance the **trust and security** of the blockchain.
- They ensure the system remains functional and **resilient** in decentralized environments without manual intervention.

# Forks in Blockchain

1. **Definition of Forks**:
    
    - A fork represents a divergence in the blockchain’s path.
    - Common types: **Hard Fork** and **Soft Fork**.
2. **Soft Fork**:
    
    - A **minor protocol change** or adjustment.
    - Backward-compatible with older nodes that haven't updated.
    - Example: The **scrypt concept** in Bitcoin was introduced via a soft fork.
    - Comparable to applying a **software patch** or a **bug fix**.
3. **Hard Fork**:
    
    - A **major protocol change** leading to two **incompatible chains**.
    - Requires all nodes to upgrade to stay on the same chain.
    - Planned Example: Ethereum's transition from **Homestead** to **Metropolis Byzantium**.
    - Unplanned Example: **Ethereum Classic** split from **Ethereum Core** due to the DAO hack.
4. **Ethereum’s Hard Fork on October 17, 2017**:
    
    - **Planned Fork** introducing several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs):
        - **Parallel processing of transactions**.
        - Introduction of **Proof of Stake (PoS)** consensus every 100 blocks (while keeping Proof of Work as primary).
        - **Block creation incentives** reduced from 5 ETH to 3 ETH.
5. **Purpose of Forks**:
    
    - Soft Forks: Address **minor issues** and enhance functionality.
    - Hard Forks: Implement **major upgrades** and fix critical flaws.
    - Forks contribute to the **robustness and trust** in blockchain by managing faults and enabling planned improvements.
6. **Analogy**:
    
    - **Soft Fork**: Software patch.
    - **Hard Fork**: New operating system version.
7. **Key Insights**:
    
    - Forks are a **normal evolutionary process** in blockchain technology.
    - Well-managed forks enhance **credibility** and **resilience** of the blockchain framework.
    - Observing major forks, such as Ethereum’s upgrades, provides insights into blockchain evolution.

### Important Takeaways:

- Forks signify adaptability and continuous improvement in blockchain.
- **Compatibility** is a key differentiator: soft forks maintain it, hard forks do not.
- The blockchain community actively plans and executes forks to address challenges and advance technology.
