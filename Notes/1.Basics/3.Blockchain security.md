# Public Key Cryptography

### **Problem with Decentralized Networks**

- **No Trust:** Participants don’t know each other, so traditional ID checks (e.g., driver's license) are not feasible.
- **Key Questions:**
    - How to identify participants?
    - How to authenticate transactions?
    - How to detect forged or faulty transactions?
- **Solution:** Public-Key Cryptography.

---

### ** Symmetric Key Encryption (Old Method)**

- **How it Works:**
    
    - Same key used for encryption and decryption.
    - Example: Caesar Cipher (shifts alphabets by a fixed number).
- **Issues in Decentralized Systems:**
    
    1. **Key Derivation:** Easy to derive the key from encrypted data.
    2. **Key Distribution:** Hard to securely share keys among unknown participants.

---

## ** Public-Key Cryptography (Modern Method)**

- **Key Features:**
    
    - Two keys: **Private Key** (secret) and **Public Key** (shared openly).
    - Data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other.
- **Example Use Case:**
    
    - Participant in Buffalo (Key Pair: b, B).
    - Participant in Kathmandu (Key Pair: k, K).
    - **Encryption Process:**
        1. Buffalo encrypts the message using:
            - Its private key (b).
            - Kathmandu’s public key (K).
        2. Kathmandu decrypts using:
            - Its private key (k).
            - Buffalo’s public key (B).
    - **Result:**
        - Only Kathmandu can read the message (privacy).
        - The message authenticity is ensured (only Buffalo could send it).

### **Public-Key Algorithms**

- **RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman):**
    
    - Used in applications like passwordless login (e.g., Amazon cloud).
    - Strength depends on key size (e.g., 3072-bit RSA key).
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):**
    
    - Used in Bitcoin and Ethereum.
    - **Why ECC?**
        - Stronger than RSA for the same key size.
        - Example: **256-bit ECC key ≈ 3072-bit RSA key strength.**
    - **Efficiency:** Critical for frequent operations in blockchain protocols.

# Hashing


## **Why Learn About Hashing and Encryption?**

- **Private/Public Key Pair:** Your "passport" to using blockchain.
    - **Private Key:** Keep it secure to protect your assets.
- **Hashing:**
    - Ensures transaction integrity and data confidentiality.
    - Common terms: hash rate, hash power, etc.

---

## **What is Hashing?**

- **Definition:** A process that transforms any data (input) into a fixed-length, unique value (output).
    - Example: Input = "Hello," Hash Output = "a1b2c3d4."
- **Key Features:**
    1. **One-Way Function:** Impossible to reverse the hash to get the original data.
        - Analogy: You can’t turn mashed potatoes back into whole potatoes.
    2. **Collision-Free:** Two different inputs won’t produce the same hash value.

---

### **Why Use 256-Bit Hashes?**

- **Hash Size:** 256 bits = 2^256 possible values (~10^77 combinations).
- **Odds of Collision:** Less likely than a meteor hitting your house.

---

### **Hashing Algorithms Used in Blockchain:**

- **Common Algorithms:**
    - SHA-3, SHA-256, Keccak-256.
- **Applications in Ethereum:**
    - Generating account addresses.
    - Digital signatures.
    - Transaction, state, receipt, and block header hashes.

---

## **Types of Hashing Approaches**

1. **Simple Hash:**
    
    - Data is arranged linearly and hashed together.
    - ![[Pasted image 20250114112011.png]]
    - Used when:
        - **Fixed items:** E.g., block header.
        - Verifying the overall block integrity.
2. **Merkle Tree Hash:**
    
    - Data is at the leaf nodes of a tree.
    - Leaves are hashed in pairs to compute the final hash.
	    ![[Pasted image 20250114112131.png]]
    - Used when:
        - **Variable items:** E.g., transactions, states, receipts.
    - **Why Trees?**
        - Efficient for repeated operations (e.g., updates in transactions/states).
        - Faster verification: Log(N) vs. N.

# Transaction Integrity?

To protect transactions in a decentralized network, we must:

1. **Secure Unique Account Addresses:** Identify participants uniquely.
2. **Authorize Transactions:** Ensure only the sender can approve.
3. **Verify Data Integrity:** Ensure the transaction isn’t modified.

---

### **How Are Account Addresses Created?**

1. **Private Key Generation:**
    - Create a **256-bit random number** as the private key.
    - Keep it secure with a passphrase.
2. **Public Key Generation:**
    - Use **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** to derive the public key from the private key.
3. **Address Creation:**
    - Apply a **hashing function** to the public key to create a 20-byte (160-bit) **account address**.

---

## **How Are Transactions Secured?**

### **1. Digital Signing Process:**

- A **digital signature** ensures the transaction is:
    - **Authorized:** Only the sender can approve.
    - **Non-Repudiable:** The sender cannot deny the transaction.
    - **Unmodifiable:** No changes can be made to the transaction data.

**Steps for Digital Signing:**

1. **Hash the Data:**
    - Hash the transaction fields to create a unique hash value.
2. **Encrypt the Hash:**
    - Use the **private key** of the sender to encrypt the hash.
    - This forms the **digital signature.**
3. **Add the Hash to the Transaction:**
    - The encrypted hash (digital signature) is included in the transaction.

### **2. Verification by Receiver:**

- The receiver:
    1. **Decrypts the Hash:**
        - Uses the sender’s **public key** to decrypt the hash from the digital signature.
    2. **Recomputes the Hash:**
        - Hashes the original transaction data again.
    3. **Compares Hashes:**
        - If the recomputed hash matches the decrypted hash:
            - Transaction is valid.
        - If not:
            - Transaction is rejected.

---

### **Additional Verifications:**

For complete validation:

- **Timestamp:** Ensures the transaction is recent.
- **Nonce:** Prevents duplicate transactions.
- **Account Balance:** Checks if the sender has enough funds.
- **Sufficient Fees:** Ensures gas/transaction fees are covered.


## Example: Securing a Blockchain Transaction

Let’s follow the process of securing a transaction between **Alice** and **Bob** on the blockchain.

---

#### **Scenario**

- **Alice** wants to send 10 Ether (ETH) to **Bob**.
- The blockchain ensures the transaction is authorized, tamper-proof, and verifiable using hashing and public/private key cryptography.

---

### **Step 1: Account Addresses**

1. **Alice’s Address Creation**:
    - **Private Key:** Alice generates a **256-bit private key**: `a1b2c3d4...`.
    - **Public Key:** Using ECC, her public key is derived: `A12345...`.
    - **Account Address:** A hash of the public key creates Alice’s address: `0x123...`.
2. **Bob’s Address Creation:**
    - Bob also has a private key (`b5c6d7...`), public key (`B67890...`), and address: `0x456...`.

---

### **Step 2: Alice Creates the Transaction**

The transaction includes:

- **Sender Address:** Alice’s address (`0x123...`).
- **Receiver Address:** Bob’s address (`0x456...`).
- **Amount:** 10 ETH.
- **Other Details:** Nonce, timestamp, and gas fees.

---

### **Step 3: Digital Signing**

To authorize the transaction:

1. **Hashing the Data:**
    - The transaction data (amount, addresses, etc.) is hashed into a unique value:  
        **Hash:** `abcd1234...`.
2. **Encrypting the Hash:**
    - Alice encrypts the hash using her **private key (`a1b2c3d4...`)**.
    - This creates the **digital signature**: `xyz9876...`.
3. **Appending the Signature:**
    - The digital signature is added to the transaction.

---

### **Step 4: Broadcasting the Transaction**

- Alice’s transaction is broadcast to the blockchain network.

---

### **Step 5: Miners Validate the Transaction**

Miners validate the transaction by:

1. **Decrypting the Digital Signature:**
    - Miners use **Alice’s public key (`A12345...`)** to decrypt the signature.
    - This gives the original hash: `abcd1234...`.
2. **Recomputing the Hash:**
    - Miners hash the transaction data again and compare it to the decrypted hash.
3. **Checking Other Validations:**
    - Nonce, timestamp, gas fees, and Alice’s account balance are verified.

---

### **Step 6: Adding the Transaction to a Block**

- If all validations pass, the transaction is added to the next block on the blockchain.
- Bob can now see the 10 ETH credited to his account.

---

### **What Happens if Something is Tampered?**

- **Example:** If someone modifies the transaction (e.g., changes 10 ETH to 100 ETH):
    - The hash of the tampered data would no longer match the decrypted hash.
    - Miners would reject the transaction as invalid.

---

This process ensures that:

- Only **Alice** can authorize the transaction (using her private key).
- The transaction data remains tamper-proof.
- Anyone (miners, Bob) can verify the authenticity using Alice’s public key.

# Ethereum Block Structure and Integrity Management

## Key Components of an Ethereum Block:

1. **Block Header**: Includes critical metadata such as:
    
    - **Transaction Root (Hash)**: A Merkle root hash summarizing all transactions in the block.
    - **State Root (Hash)**: A hash of the blockchain state after applying all transactions in the block.
    - Other items necessary for proof-of-work or consensus.
2. **Transactions**: Includes individual transaction details and their hash values.
    
3. **State**: Represents the system's state (e.g., account balances, smart contract states) before and after the block.

	![[Pasted image 20250115102041.png]]

---

## How Integrity Is Ensured:

1. **Block Hash**:
    
    - The **block hash** is a unique identifier generated by hashing all the items in the block header (using the Keccak variant of the SHA-3 algorithm).
    - The hash ensures that even a small change in the header contents will produce a completely different hash.
2. **Merkle Tree Hash**:
    
    - A tree structure that organizes transaction hashes efficiently.
    - It allows:
        - Quick detection of tampering.
        - Efficient transaction validation.
    - To verify a transaction, only the path from the transaction to the Merkle root needs to be checked (not the entire block).
3. **State Root Hash**:
    
    - Tracks changes in the blockchain state.
    - Efficiently re-computed using Merkle trees after smart contract execution or state updates. Only affected paths in the tree are updated, not the entire state.
4. **Receipts Root Hash**:
    
    - Represents the root of all transaction receipts (outcomes of transactions).
    - Ensures quick verification of transaction results.

---

## Block Hash Computation in Ethereum:

1. **Steps to Compute Block Hash**:
    
    - Compute the **state root hash**.
    - Compute the **transaction root hash**.
    - Compute the **receipt root hash**.
    - Combine these with other header metadata (e.g., timestamp, previous block hash).
    - Apply the Keccak algorithm to produce the block hash.
2. **Purpose of the Block Hash**:
    
    - **Integrity Verification**:
        - If any data in the block is tampered with, the hash value changes, invalidating the block.
    - **Chain Linking**:
        - The block hash is included in the next block's header, creating an immutable chain.

---

### Efficiency and Immutability:

1. **Merkle Tree Efficiency**:
    
    - For tamper detection or validation, only one path of the tree is re-computed or checked, not the entire dataset.
	![[Pasted image 20250115102145.png]]
2. **State Transition Efficiency**:
    
    - When a state is modified, only the affected paths and their hashes are recalculated (e.g., if state `19` changes to `20`, only the corresponding Merkle path is updated).
3. **Enforcing Immutability**:
    
    - If a node tampers with the block, its local chain becomes invalid due to hash mismatches.
    - Other miners reject blocks from the tampered chain, maintaining blockchain integrity.
